# Password Manager:

## How It Works:
1. Encryption: The passwords are encrypted using the cryptography.Fernet symmetric encryption system. A key is generated and saved in a file (secret.key). This key is required for both encryption and decryption.
2. Password Generation: You can generate random passwords using the generate_password function.
3. Storing Passwords: When a password is generated or entered by the user, it's encrypted and stored in a CSV file (passwords.csv).
4. Viewing Passwords: Stored passwords are decrypted before being shown to the user.
5. File Security: Passwords are saved in a CSV file, and the contents are encrypted to ensure that even if the file is accessed, the passwords remain secure.

## Key Operations:
- Storing: When a password is stored, it is encrypted before being written to the CSV.
- Loading: When the stored passwords are viewed, they are decrypted using the saved encryption key.

## Example Interaction:
```

4. Exit
Choose an option (1-4): 2
Enter the service name (e.g., 'Google'): Google
Enter the password to store (or leave empty to generate one): 

Password for Google stored successfully.

# SSH Manager:
This is a Python-based SSH Manager that allows users to store, update, remove, and test SSH credentials securely. The credentials (including private/public SSH keys, usernames, and passwords) are encrypted using the cryptography library for security. This script also supports generating new SSH key pairs and uploading public keys to remote servers.

## Features
- Store SSH credentials: Save SSH username, password, private key, and public key securely in a CSV file.
- Update SSH credentials: Update an existing SSH entry based on the service name.
- Remove SSH credentials: Remove a specific entry from the stored SSH credentials.
- Test SSH connection: Connect to remote servers using stored SSH credentials and test the connection.
- Generate SSH keys: Generate a new RSA SSH key pair (private and public).
- Upload public key: Upload the generated or existing public key to a server's authorized_keys.
- Encrypt and decrypt data: SSH credentials are encrypted using a key generated by the cryptography library.
## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `cryptography` library
- `paramiko` library
- To install the required dependencies, run the following command:
```pip install cryptography paramiko```
## Usage
1. Store SSH credentials
   - Select option 1 to store SSH credentials.
   - You will be prompted to enter:
        - Service name (e.g., MyServer)
        - SSH username
        - SSH password (leave empty if using a private key)
        - SSH private key (optional, if you wish to use an existing key)
        - SSH public key (optional, if you use an existing key)
        - Hostname (e.g., example.com)
    
    The credentials will be stored securely in a CSV file (ssh_credentials.csv), with passwords and keys encrypted.

2. View stored SSH credentials
   - Select option 2 to view the stored SSH credentials.
   - The credentials are decrypted and displayed in the terminal.
3. Test SSH connection
   - Select option 3 to test a connection to a server using stored SSH credentials.
   - You can connect using either the SSH username/password or a private key if available.
4. List public key
   - Select option 4 to list the public key of a specific service.
   - You will be prompted to enter the service name, and the public key will be displayed.
5. Upload SSH public key to server
   - Select option 5 to upload the SSH public key to a server's authorized_keys file.
   - You will be prompted to enter the service name, and the script will upload the key to the specified server and test the connection.
6. Update SSH credentials
   - Select option 7 to update existing SSH credentials.
   - You will be prompted to enter the new credentials (username, password, private key, public key, hostname).
   - The credentials will be updated in the CSV file.
7. Exit
   - Select option 8 to exit the program.

## Key Functions
1. `generate_key()`
   - Generates a new encryption key used to encrypt and decrypt the SSH credentials.
2. `save_key(key, filename="ssh_secret.key")`
   - Saves the generated encryption key to a file for later use.
3. `load_key(filename="ssh_secret.key")`
   - Loads the encryption key from a file.
4. `encrypt_message(message, key)`
    - Encrypts a given message (e.g., SSH username, password, or key) using the encryption key.
5. `decrypt_message(encrypted_message, key)`
    - Decrypts a given encrypted message using the encryption key.
6. `store_ssh_credentials(username, password, private_key, public_key, hostname, service_name, key)`
   - Stores the provided SSH credentials (username, password, private key, public key, and hostname) into a CSV file, with encryption applied to sensitive information.
7. `load_ssh_credentials(key, filename="ssh_credentials.csv")`
    - Loads SSH credentials from the CSV file and decrypts the information using the provided encryption key.
8. `update_creds(username, password, private_key, public_key, hostname, service_name, key, filename="ssh_credentials.csv")`
    - Updates the stored SSH credentials for a specific service, replacing the old credentials with new ones.
9. `remove_ssh_credentials(service_name, key, filename="ssh_credentials.csv")`
    - Removes the SSH credentials for a specific service from the CSV file.
10.  `connect_ssh(username, password=None, private_key=None, hostname='localhost', port=22)`
    - Establishes an SSH connection to a server using either username/password or private key authentication.
11.  `generate_ssh_key_pair(service_name)`
    - Generates a new RSA key pair (private and public keys) and saves them to disk.
12.  `upload_ssh_key_to_server(hostname, username, password, private_key, service_name)`
     - Uploads the public SSH key to the specified server's authorized_keys file, allowing SSH access without a password.

## Notes
- The script assumes that the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the remote server is writable.
- It is crucial to protect the ssh_secret.key file as it is used for encryption and decryption.
- Always ensure the private key files are securely stored and protected.
